Birds out on my window ledge
Discuss their rights to use my hedge.
They squawk and squabble, as they dredge
Through social climates on my ledge.

Who should stay and who should go?
They push each other to and fro.
The only purpose they could know
Leaves with lesser birds in tow.

If one should be that lesser bird,
Surely, first he would be heard.
Fighting, though he’s just a nerd.
I’ll remember every word.
