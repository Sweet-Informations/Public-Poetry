They’re merrily meeting you,
Barely mistreating you,
Sharing their most cherished wares when they’re seating you,
Once you get settled and love what you’re eating,
You suddenly see that they’re carelessly cheating.
No wonder they’re feeding you charity greetings.
They trick every Tom, Dick, and Harry competing.
With parity fleeting, they’re verily beating you.
Scary who they would impede when they’re needing to.
